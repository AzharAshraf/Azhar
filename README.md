<h1>10 easy steps for beginners on physical computing (Arduino)</h1>
experts was once beginners too! so Im here just to help you ease out the process on physical computing. JUST with 10 steps :)



  <p><h2>1. What is Arduino?</h2></p>
  Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. In other words, a cute way of being on a cricut IN REAL LIFE!You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.

  <p><h3>2. before you start... </h3></p>
Before you begin plugging things into your new Arduino, it may be good to know what can damage the board.
<ul>
  <li>Drawing more than 40mA from an output pin.</li>
  <li>Drawing more than 200mA from all output pins together.</li>
  <li>Supplying more than 5v to the 5v pin</li>
  <li>Reversing the polarity of the power supply</li>
</ul>
SO DONT! lol



 <p><h4>3. KNOW your equipment </h4></p>
 Before you start anything, be prepared!!! It is important to see what electronics Aruduino give you. So have a play around. See what they have on offer AND have fun with it.
 
 
 
 <p><h5>4. Hardware & Electronics </h5></p>
 Before we begin, I'll explain some of the basic electronic components. If you only just started with electronics, this is for you!
 <ul>
  <li>Electricity is the flow of electric charge carriers: electrons (in most cases).</li>
  <li>Electrons are the negatively charged particles that whirl around the positively charged nucleus of an atom.</li>
  <li>Resistors are components with - as the name implies - an electrical resistance, in other words, they limit the flow of electrons, so they are often used to limit the current.</li>
  <li>You can power your Arduino from a USB port, but this solution is limited to 5v and only 500mA, so if you want to use things like motors, or things that require a higher voltage, you'll need a power supply.</li>
</ul>
